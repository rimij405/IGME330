                        <h3>Major of Study?</h3>
                        <p>I am working towards a Bachelor of Science degree for Game Design &amp; Development. Prior to RIT, I attended the Bronx Highschool of Science, where I was lucky enough to have access to a strong AP Computer Science course, and post-AP game development course. </p>

                        <h3>The RIT Experience</h3>
                        <p>Currently working through my third year of university, I've enjoyed much of my time on RIT's campus. Getting involved with student life, I've stood as an eboard member in various organizations, including (but not limited to): RIT Mental Graffiti, International House, and Asian American Alliance. I am the current President of International House, one of the seven special interest houses on dorm-side, that offer first-years (who apply) access to a fully-stocked kitchen and to community events. Last year, I travelled to Chicago as part of RIT's slam poetry team, where we competed in CUPSI, progressing all the way to semi-finals. As of the start of the current semester, I've been employed as an official peer consultant in the Writing Commons, using my knowledge as a writing consultant to help make our campus writers even better.</p>

                        <h3>Where do you want to be when you graduate?</h3>
                        <p>During Summer 2017, I interned at Sesame Workshop, in their Digital Production department. My time there has gave me the grounding I was in search of, worrying about my opportunities for the future. With a large international presence, I can see my time there being fruitful, for both the people I'll work with, and for myself. I believe that I was very lucky to be provided with the opportunity to meet such wonderful people, and, I anticipate that a lot of hard work will be accomplished in my time there, should I return. I want to challenge myself and the idea of making video games that are both engaging and educational for children, pushes me to be the best I can be in full-stack web development technologies. </p>
