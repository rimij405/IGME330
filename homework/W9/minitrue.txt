<h2>1984</h2>
<p>BY GEORGE ORWELL</p>

<p>The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official
language of Oceania.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It
was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring
up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston
stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in
elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:</p>

<ul>
    <li>WAR IS PEACE</li>
    <li>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</li>
    <li>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</li>
</ul>
